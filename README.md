Even if you dgaf about me, another human being, I think you still should find out what happened and are still happening.\
Unless you are part of the persecutors group.\
Please read my experience as a persecuted on my [diary](https://github.com/pers2022/asylum_diary) and find out how messed up our societies are.

I believe the situation is that Lithuania helped the Chinese Communist Party to continue their persecution and the UK helpes them to continue.

A huge problem of the situation is that the autorities of countries as well as their lackeys, which are a huge number from all kinds of governmental or non-governmental organisation, are on the side of the persecutors

I am not asking for help anymore.\
Of course, if the situation can change for the better, I probably will still welcome it.\
But I don't even know how anyone can help.\
Nor do I feel that "after" is a thing.\
But I believe those who are not part of the persecution group need to know this.\
Think about how all that I wrote at https://github.com/pers2022/asylum_diary became possiblle.\
Think about what implications there are.

Not only am I, a nobody, under an absurdly extreme surveillance. An absurd number of them stalk, harass and smear me everywhere.
I do not doubt that they have a number of narratives. I do not doubt they can paint me in bad colours. I do not doubt they ruin my life. They already did. Even my health is already ruined.\
Remember that it's not just about me. It's their behaviours and mentalities that you should think about.
