Even if you dgaf about me, another human being, I think you still should find out what happened and are still happening.\
Unless you are part of the persecutors group.\
Please read my experience as a persecuted on my [diary](https://github.com/pers2022/asylum_diary) and find out how messed up our societies are.

Please don't look away because there are others looking into the matters, even if they are the authorities. The persecutors have immense influence and number. There is a high chance that the ones you see looking into the matter are those of the persecutors group.\
I want the attention of every one that are not of the persecutors group.\
And every one of you need to know what is happening.


I think the situation is that Lithuania helped the Chinese Communist Party to continue their persecution and the UK helpes them to continue.

A huge problem of the situation is that the autorities of countries as well as their lackeys, which are a huge number from all kinds of governmental or non-governmental organisation, are on the side of the persecutors.

I am not asking for help anymore.\
Of course, if the situation can change for the better, I probably will still welcome it.\
But I don't even know how anyone can help.\
Nor do I feel that "after" is a thing.\
But I believe those who are not part of the persecution group need to know this.\
Think about how all that I wrote at https://github.com/pers2022/asylum_diary became possiblle.\
Think about what implications there are.

Not only am I, a nobody, under an absurdly extreme surveillance. An absurd number of them stalk, harass and smear me everywhere.
I do not doubt that they have a number of narratives. I do not doubt they can paint me in bad colours. I do not doubt they ruin my life. They already did. Even my health is already ruined.\
Remember that it's not just about me. It's their behaviours and mentalities that you should think about.

**some of the things I am faced with in the UK (many of them also happened before I came to the UK)**
- letters and packages are intercepted
- authorities such as police are not helping. Quite the opposite, I have been arrested under absurd circumstances.
- under extreme surveillance
- privacy and information are disclosed for fun and for facilitating stalking, harassment and assualts.
- frequently get drugged or put under various effects with other means
- cannot get any proper information. Cannot get proper responses anywhere.

**overly simplified summary**
- sensed danger in Hong Kong
- got an email address from the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw for volunteering attempt. No response
- sought asylum in Lithuania. Sensed the presence of the persecutors in both Poland and Lithuania
- started out with the best intentions. Faced with endless organised harassment, insults, health damages
- wanted to appeal against the decision because the document contained unacceptable non-sense
- left when realised that even the appeal was fake
- trapped at Riga International Airport, got robbed before allowed to leave
- sought asylum in the UK
- faced with further organised harassment, insults, health damages. And also organised assualts and false accusation. Got a warning from the Hertfordshire Police
- continue till this day
