Even if you dgaf about me, I think you still should find out what happened and are still happening.<br>
Unless you are part of the persecutors group.<br>
Please read my experience as a persecuted on my [diary](https://github.com/pers2022/asylum_diary) and find out how messed up our societies are.<br>

I believe the situation is that Lithuania helped the Chinese Communist Party to continue their persecution and the UK helpes them to continue.<br>

A huge problem of the situation is that the autorities of countries as well as their lackeys, which are a huge number from all kinds of governmental or non-governmental organisation, are on the side of the persecutors.<br>

I am not asking for help anymore.\
Of course, if the situation can change for the better, I probably will still welcome it.\
But I don't even know how anyone can help.<br>
Nor do I feel that "after" is a thing.<br>
But I believe those who are not part of the persecution group need to know this.<br>
Think about how all that I wrote at https://github.com/pers2022/asylum_diary became possiblle.<br>
Think about what implications there are.<br>
